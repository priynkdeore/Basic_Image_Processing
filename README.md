                                             Tutorial for Image Processing in Python

Section 1: Basic Image Processing-Basic image processing involves fundamental operations to manipulate and analyze digital images. These operations are often the building blocks for advanced computer vision tasks


Section 2: Feature Detection -Feature detection is a crucial part of computer vision, where unique points or patterns in an image are identified to understand its structure, match different images, or track objects. These features are often used in object recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction.
